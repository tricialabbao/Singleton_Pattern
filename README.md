## Centralized Queuing System for Pag-IBIG Office

The Pag-IBIG Office implements a centralized queuing system to efficiently manage visitors across three help desk stations. Individuals visiting the office obtain a queue number from this centralized system, ensuring an organized and fair service process.

Additionally, there is an online monitoring system that displays the current queued number in real time for individuals monitoring the queue remotely.

Each help desk station includes an option to reset the queue number based on an inputted value. This provides flexibility for managing the queue during specific circumstances, such as reorganization or technical issues. The centralized system maintains a single unified queue number shared across all help desk stations, while the reset functionality provides control and adaptability when needed.

This approach ensures an organized queuing experience for individuals visiting the office and offers the flexibility to handle adjustments as necessary.
